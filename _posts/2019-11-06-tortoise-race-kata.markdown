## Problem

Two tortoises named *A* and *B* must run a race. *A* starts with an average speed of 720 feet per hour. Young *B* knows she runs faster than *A*, and furthermore has not finished her cabbage.

When she starts, at last, she can see that *A* has a 70 feet lead but *B*‘s speed is 850 feet per hour. How long will it take *B* to catch *A*?

More generally: given two speeds `v1` (*A*‘s speed, integer > 0) and `v2` (*B*‘s speed, integer > 0) and a lead `g` (integer > 0) how long will it take *B* to catch *A*?

The result will be an array `[hour, min, sec]` which is the time needed in hours, minutes and seconds (round down to the nearest second) or a string in some languages.

## My answer

```csharp
public static int[] Race(int v1, int v2, int g)
{
  if (v1 < v2)
  {
    int dv = (v2 - v1); // net fph
    int hr = g / dv;
    int min = 60 * (g % dv) / dv;

    int[] time = new int[] {hr, min, sec};
    return time;
  }

  return null;
}
```
