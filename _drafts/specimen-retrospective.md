On Tuesday I uploaded the v1.0 release of our game [Specimen](https://metapilgrim.itch.io/specimen), a top-down RPG in the style and vein of [Diablo](https://diablo2.blizzard.com/en-us/). Specimen was the culmination of just over seven months of work with [Neil Quillen](http://www.neilquillen.com/) and [Zane Heer](https://www.artstation.com/zanheer/profile). Check it out on my [itch page](https://metapilgrim.itch.io) along with the [rest of my games](https://grahamewatt.com/games). It takes about ~45 minutes to play all the way through. We're pumped about the final result and I hope you enjoy it!  

I learned a massive amount during the process, far too much to fit into a single reasonably-sized article. 

# Concept

Neil and I got the project started fairly soon after wrapping up our GMTK 2023 entry, [Casting Lots](https://r0nnie.itch.io/castinglots). I had finally started to settle into our new life in Seattle, work wasn't particularly stressful, and I was looking for something with a bit more meat than a game jam project.
