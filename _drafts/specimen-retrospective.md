On Tuesday I uploaded the v1.0 release of our game *[Specimen](https://metapilgrim.itch.io/specimen)*, a top-down RPG in the style and vein of [Diablo](https://diablo2.blizzard.com/en-us/). *Specimen* was the culmination of just over seven months of work with [Neil Quillen](http://www.neilquillen.com/) and [Zane Heer](https://www.artstation.com/zanheer/profile). Check it out on my [itch page](https://metapilgrim.itch.io) along with the [rest of my games](https://grahamewatt.com/games). It takes about ~45 minutes to play all the way through. We're pumped about the final result and I hope you enjoy it!  

I learned a massive amount during the process, far too much to fit into a single reasonably-sized article. 

## Conception

Neil and I got the project started fairly soon after wrapping up our GMTK 2023 entry, [Casting Lots](https://r0nnie.itch.io/castinglots). I had finally started to settle into our new life in Seattle, my work-life balance was pretty solid, and I was looking for something a bit more involved than you normally get out of a game jam experience. It's one thing to hack a game together in a mad scramble for the finish, another thing entirely to have to come up with a project plan, iterate, and develop in a more "professional" capacity. I wanted to know what that process was like, where the pitfalls lay, and understand what parts of my <span name="just-software">tech background actually apply</span> to game dev.

<aside name="just-software">It is just software development after all</aside>

We agreed on a time frame of 4-6 months, working part time. Evenings here, weekends there, that sort of thing. Neil, a professional composer, was going to do absolutely <span name="no-composition">no composition</span> for the game and instead take on the game design role. I wasn't really interested in doing much design; I was more interested in better understanding the operation and production process, as well as getting to program something a little bit more sophisticated than the bodged-together products I'd done in the past.

<aside name="no-composition">Well, not <em>zero</em> composition, but it certianly wasn't going to be his primary focus&mdash;that would be too much like work</aside>

We roped in Zane, who we'd worked with on [Some of Our Parts](https://metapilgrim.itch.io/some-of-your-parts) to do art. Between us, that was a full squad with all the major disciplines more-or-less covered, and so in early August 2022 we began to brainstorm.

## Ideation

Because it was a fully-volunteer project we hadn't set any constraints on the type of game we were going to make. We didn't really have many scope constraints either beyond "what do we think we can make in six months?" That was an important constraint, but we didn't really tie much to it beyond evaluating the various pitches with the gut feeling of "what feels big." And since we were all trying to push ourselves to do new things and explore new areas, none of us had particularly well-calibrated sensors to judge things with.

We spent about a month and a half meeting about ideas, sketching out mechanics and concept art. We had a few really interesting ideas come out of the whole process&mdash;perhaps they'll resurface in future games:

- *Merchant's Journey*, a upbeat deck-building adventure based around negotiations and bargining,
- *Runebearers*, a JRPG-style adventure where the characters all manifest magic runes that change depending on player decisions,
- *Empty Planet*, an open-world planet exploration game with *Myst*-style puzzles
- *Fauna,* where *Princess Mononoke* meets the evolution-mechanics of *Spore*

HOLD FOR IMAGES

Ultimately, we went with what would become *[Specimen](https://metapilgrim.itch.io/specimen)*, a *Diablo*-inspired adventure game about a mad scientist exploring a scary forest with a bunch of freaky minions. We also made the decision to go 3D instead of 2D, which was definitely going to push all of us. I hadn't done a 3D game since I made *[Corvebawl](https://grahamewatt.com/games/corvebawl)*, and Zane was signing up to <span name="bold-move">dive headfirst</span> into the world of 3D modelling. 

<aside name="bold-move">Bold. We like bold.</aside>
